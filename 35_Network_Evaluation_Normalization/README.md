# dsc-DeloitteAIA-021224-A ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆÂ -  Neural Network Evaluation and Normalization


This repository contains material describing concepts relating to model evaluation and normalization. All the same ingredients of model running and tuning also apply to neural networks -   a loss function, overfitting vs underfitting, and coefficients (weights), normalization/standardization and regularization. Here we explore these concepts as they relate to neural networks.
